## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```css
display: grid;
background-color: hsl(230, 75%, 98%);
grid-template-columns: auto 2.5fr 1.5fr;
width: 75%;
margin: 1.4em 1em 1.875em 1.3em;
padding: 0.9375em 0.9375em 1.25em 0.3125em;
align-items: center;
border-radius: 0.625em;
column-gap: 0.625em;
```

### Continued development

I would be looking forward making the website mobile responsive in the future and fixing all the bugs.

### Useful resources

- [Grid: The basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout) - This helped me get started with using grid.
